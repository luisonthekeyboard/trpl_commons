# TRPL Commons

A Commons Library based on learning from 
["The Rust Programming Language" (TRPL) Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

This project is probably of no use whatsoever, except to learn and study. I'm using it to experiment with creating 
functions, modules, visibility, and pushing updates to libraries on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
